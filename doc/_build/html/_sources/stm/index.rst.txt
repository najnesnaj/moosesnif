STM microcontrollers used with CAN
==================================

Since I was inspired by the openinverter project to acquire some new skills (https://openinverter.org/wiki/Main_Page), I went trough my drawer to scramble all the STM hardware together, since that is what they use. The programming is done using libopencm3.

Eventually I bought some cheap stm32 boards which were low spec, but still usefull for CAN communication.
