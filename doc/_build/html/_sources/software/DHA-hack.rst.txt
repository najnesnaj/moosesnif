GGD-DHA ( Generic Global Diagnostic - Hacking ) .
=====================================================================



This software uses databases in (ddb, dds) format.
The cool thing is that this software works with the DICE cable.
ddb format can be edited.

I created a small database for working with my V50.
I can extract the CANBUS messages from the VIDA database.

I created a sample to interact with a stm32, so it send a serial number upon request, pretending it is an ECM module (0x50).
