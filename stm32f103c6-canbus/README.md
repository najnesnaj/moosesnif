# this software works with a cheap stm32f103c6 (should work for c8 equally well)

the software reacts to a request on the canbus for ECM (0x50), and sends a serial number (works with DHA software and database and DICE cable)

With this method, modifying/completing the text-only database, allows for interacting with all the modules in your car
